<p>The Ocean Cleanup is a nonprofit organization with a goal to rid the world's oceans of plastic. They develop advanced technologies to help with that and have gone through
a few prototypes already. There are still improvements to be made, but read on to see how you can get involved.</p>
<p>Plastic in the ocean is not surprising to hear about. In fact, the toothbrush you used when you were 8 years old is probably somewhere in the ocean right now. Yep, the very same one.</p>
<p>That is why The Ocean Cleanup is doing what they're doing right nowâ€”cleaning up the ocean. But, it can't be only
them doing the work. We should do our part, too.</p>
<p>To start, please stop using single-use plastic bottles. You know, the bulk ones from the store. If it's for your lunch or morning run,
just fill up a reusable bottle and go on with your day. If it's for a party, you can use those big water jugs and provide paper cups for your guests.</p>
<div><img src="img/image13.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 0 15px; width: 500px"></div>
<p>Try not to use plastic toothbrushes and use bamboo ones instead. Here's a few companies that sell them: Mother's Value, The Green Root, and Baboo. When you
go for your weekly grocery shopping, don't use plastic bags. Tote bags exist and cost about $0.99. Way less than the cost of a sea creature's life
when using plastic bags.</p>
<p>You can also directly help The Ocean Cleanup by <a href="https://www.theoceancleanup.com/support/" style="color: blue">donating</a>. And if you want to be in the action, visit their careers page.</p>
<p>There's a lot of organizations like The Ocean Cleanup that have the same mission in mind. 4Ocean, for example, is helping out at Manila Bay, which is located in the Philippines.
The before and after pictures really blow my mind. And who knew that just a little help from everyone can result in a cleaner, healthier environment <i>just</i> like what's happening at
Manila Bay. It's still a work in progress but at least there is action being taken.</p>
<p>Look up the images on Google and watch the vlogs on YouTube about Manila Bay. You'll want to pick up all the litter in the world after seeing how far they've come.</p>
