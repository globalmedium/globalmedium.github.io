<p>As we all know, social media is everywhere and used on the daily. Picture this scenario: you wake up, look for your phone frantically just to find that it was
under that darn pillow (not a good idea btw), and immediately open up your apps to scroll through what you missed.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>If the answer is 'yes', you are among the millions of people who interact through social media. If you said 'no', then
I commend you and I should really start up a new morning routine that doesn't involve my tiny pocket screen so much.</p>
<p>Like I said a few sentences ago, social media is on every corner and used constantly. Need to vent? Reddit. Celebrity gossip?
Snapchat. Doggo memes? Instagram. Headcanon? Tumblr. Hotel? Trivago. You get it. This is exactly why it's the best
tool for environmental awareness!</p>
<p>We hear about new medical breakthroughs, celebrities that passed, and tragic events through social media. Why would
happenings about the environment be any different? In my honest opinion, there isn't enough awareness about ocean acidification, overfishing,
deforestation, waste production, etc. There is <i>some</i> awareness on these issues, but is it enough? 
And, I mean, people may <i>know</i> it's a problem, but there's no action being taken for the most part.</p>

<p>Take a look at Bretman Rock's Instagram stories for example. I knew that plastic was being overused and ended up in
oceans harming sea life. Every once in a while, he would show us what he's drinking, whether that's green juice or iced coffee, but <i>making sure</i> to show the world that he 
used a metal straw.</p>
<p>Bretman Rock is very well-known for his makeup line, funny content, and down-to-earth persona. That's what makes him famous, that's what
makes him Bretman Rock. Of course, no one would have discovered him if not for social media. He has built up quite a presence
on social media and uses these platforms to promote metal straws. His constant reminder of how plastic straws are being overused and taking
over ocean life made me drive out to T.J. Maxx to buy my own pack of metal straws. Now, I try to urge people around me to do the same.
This is how social media works. It's like a chain reaction.</p>
<p>But this is just one example of many.</p>
<p>So, I urge green companies to keep pushing it on the social media thing and have planet Earth thank us once in a while for looking after it.
We all live under the same sky alongside other human beings from different parts of the world, creatures of the land, air, and sea, variety of plants,
and all there is that exists on this planet. Let's take care of our home.</p>
